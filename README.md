## About Material Design

Material Design is a design language, originated from Google, which is intensively used in interfaces’ projects for the Android system. You may ask why it is used. The answer is simple – already a mature and organized tool which corresponds to the usability and legibility. Moreover, it is developing and changing dynamically. The result is the tool that may be a perfect match for screens, as well as the beginning point for inexperienced people in UI/UX designing.

The basis of MD is already well-established by website and UI/UX designers who have worked on it since a long time. What distinguishes it from other tools, is the fact you may use it in every kind of project you are currently working on, because it is easy to find recommended practices in each project set. The conventions place emphasis on:

Materials as a metaphor - in this context, it is a metaphor of space for sheet and ink. The real things that are used in this tool are light and space, supported by unique space attributes that distinguish in digital forms field. The characteristics of MD are the shadows which are widespread. It reflects the behavior of real things that exist in reality

Meaning - the incentive of MD is designing for printing what reflects in very well designed grid, the importance of typography and colors.

Movement & Animation - MD not only supports a static form of printing design but also includes the digital media, basing it on the laws of physics. It gives us the possibility of reconciling utility with aesthetics what is very important nowadays.

One of the most important metaphors in MD is a material which has its position in space on the Z-axis, so we can tell if it is closer or farther from a user. The metaphor refers to so-called Elevation value. What is interesting, it is a fact this value simulates higher and lower positions in space by appropriately selected shading.
